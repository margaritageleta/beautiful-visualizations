# PART 1 - R WORKSHOP #
# =================== #
# Well, the first comment is that with "#" you can add comments!

# Math works in R as anywhere else
4 + 2
4 - 2
4 * 2
4 / 2
4 ^ 2
4 %/% 2      # What is that ... ?
4 %% 2

# Variable assignment
x <- 4
y <- 5 %/% 2 # What is the value of y ... ?
z <- x %% y  # Guess the value of z 
# To print the assignment use ()
(t <- x)

# Some cool things 
4 -> x       # does also work! not the usual way, though
i <- j <- 3  # what is the value of i and j ?
i <- 3 + (j <- 4)
k <- i + (j <- x) # what is the value of k ?

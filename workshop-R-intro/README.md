R is in the **top 2** of Data Science programming languages (along with Python). Sometimes R leads the ranking, other times Python does. *Why?*

### Love or war? R & Python

- R is simple, but is not a general purpose programming language as Python.
- However, the inner computations (of matrices, statistical models, ...) are numerically much accurate.
- Python libraries can be tricky to configure, in contrast to R, which are straightforward.
- R is devolving into two mutually unintelligible dialects, ordinary R and the *Tidyverse*.
- Python slightly overcomes R in Machine Learning (not by much), R definitely overcomes Python in Statistical Analysis (by far).

Each language offers different advantages and drawbacks for data science work, having knowledge on each one is better, then we can choose what language suits us better in a specific project. They can be complementary (there even exist pypes between R and Python). So, definitely it is love.

### Download R and RStudio

- **R**: using the Spain Mirror, https://cran.rediris.es
- **R Studio**: IDE for R, https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

### RStudio interface & R basics

First, create a folder where you are going to store your R Scripts and datasets. After that, go to **Session**, click on **Set Working Directory** > **Choose Directory** and choose your folder. Now, you are in. Good! (this can also be done through the R console using the `setwd()` function). You can check the directory you are in with `getwd()`.

Create your first R Script clicking on **File > New File > R Script**. 



To clear the console: `cat("\014")`

R is in the **top 2** of Data Science programming languages (along with Python). Sometimes R leads the ranking, other times Python does. Why?

### Love or war: R & Python

- R is simple, but is not a general purpose programming language as Python.
- However, the inner computations (of matrices, statistical models, ...) are numerically much accurate.
- Python libraries can be tricky to configure, in contrast to R, which are straightaway.
- R is devolving into two mutually unintelligible dialects, ordinary R and the Tidyverse.
- Python slightly overcomes R in Machine Learning, R definitely overcomes Python in Statistical Analysis.

## \#1 Baby names in Catalonia
The first data visualizations are about baby names in Catalonia. You can have a look at the code in the `babynames.r` file. Yet, let's leave hard code apart and discuss some interesting results that I have obtained by analyzing those tables.

### What is the proportion between males and females in the name endings with vowels?
The number of female names ending with vowel is falling and the number of male names ending with vowel is growing. But the difference is still significative (the opposite happens with the beginnings).

### What is the mean length of names in Catalonia through years by sex?
The trend is decreasing. The names are getting shorter and shorter and females' names are, in average, longer than males'.

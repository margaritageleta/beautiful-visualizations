This repository is aimed to show my data visualizations in R.

## \#1 Baby names in Catalonia
The first data visualizations are about baby names in Catalonia. You can have a look at the code in the `babynames.r` file. Yet, let's leave hard code apart and discuss some interesting results that I have obtained by analyzing those tables.

### What is the proportion of names ending or starting with a vowel by sex?
The number of female names ending with vowel is decreasing and the number of male names ending with vowel is increasing. But the difference is still significative (the opposite happens with the beginnings).

### What is the mean name length in Catalonia through years by sex?
The trend is decreasing. The names are getting shorter and shorter and female names are, in average, longer than males'.
